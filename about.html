                    MalwareGuard is a website that detects and scans URLs and files for viruses. It is a specialized security tool that employs advanced algorithms to inspect web links and digital files for potential threats or malware. 
                    It works by analyzing the content, structure, and behavior of URLs and files, identifying patterns or signatures associated with known viruses, malware, or phishing attempts. 
                    In real-time, these websites act as a frontline defense, blocking access to suspicious links of files. 
                    MalwareGuard aims to provide quality service, hence uses two detectors that are both credible and safe. </h3>
